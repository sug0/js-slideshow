# What is this

An embarassingly simple javascript client-side image slideshow.

# How to use it

Clone this repository, and change `js/slideshow.js`. There should
be a comment there promptly indicating you what relevant variables
should be changed for your own personal usage (doubt this can be
useful to anyone else though lol).
